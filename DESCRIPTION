Title: Mocha-inspired mocking and stubbing (http://github.com/robertzk/rum)
Description: Have you ever wished to test whether a certain R function
    was called or not called? Or whether it was called with a given
    set of parameters?

    Inspired by Ruby's Mocha gem, rum aims to make it easy to write
    tests that ensure other package functions are or are not called.
    This is important because it eliminates messy stubbing that would
    have to be performed otherwise to achieve the same effect.
